Homework

For your homework this week, you’ll be polishing this mashup.

Begin by sorting the results of our search by the average score.

Then, update your script to allow the user to choose how to sort, by average, high score or most inspections:

(soupenv)$ python mashup.py highscore

Next, allow the user to choose how many results to map:

(soupenv)$ python mashup.py highscore 25

Or allow them to reverse the results, showing the lowest scores first:

(soupenv)$ python mashup.py highscore 25 reverse

If you’re feeling particularly adventurous, see if you can use the argparse module from the standard library to handle command line arguments
